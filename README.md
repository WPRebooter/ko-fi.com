# From Warehouse to WordPress — My Dev Journey

Hi there 👋  
I’m an aspiring web developer who’s making a second attempt to leave warehouse work behind and build a new life in tech.

A while ago, I tried freelancing as a WordPress developer. I learned PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, built a few small sites… but it didn’t take off. Financial pressure forced me to return to my old job in logistics.

But I didn’t give up.

This time, I’m going all in — with a clear plan, full focus, and the support of people who believe in second chances.
